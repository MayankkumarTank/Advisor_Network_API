# Advisor_Network_API

## Installing the Dependencies
I already made the requirements.txt file in the repo. So, you just do the following.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Run the project
In order to run the project, you have to first make the migrations and then run the server.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
